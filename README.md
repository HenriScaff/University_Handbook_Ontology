# University_Handbook_Ontology

## Description
This project utilizes RDF, SHACL, SPARQL, OWL and SWRL, to construct and query a knowledge graph of UWA Units and Majors. The graph's constraints are enforced, with both simple and advanced rules and properties, and new information is inferred using the Pellet reasoner. The data in the two .json files is used to construct the graph, and is sourced from UWA, and is public information.

## User Manual
A comprehensive PDF report is included, detailing the tools used in the project, and how to run the scripts.
